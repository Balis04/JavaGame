# Game Description

This project is a path-building logic game where the player must correctly place elements on a given grid to create a valid, continuous loop.

## Main Features
- Menu: Players can enter their name, choose a difficulty level, and view the game rules before starting.
- Game Board: A randomly selected map based on the chosen difficulty appears, along with all necessary elements.
- Element Placement: Elements can be placed on the board according to specific rules (e.g., bridges must be straight, mountains require 90Â° turns, and nothing can be placed on an oasis).
- Validation: The game automatically checks if the solution is correct (continuous loop, all tiles correctly connected).
- Game End: Upon completion, the elapsed time is displayed, along with the leaderboard.
- Saving: The game state can be saved and reloaded, and leaderboards are stored in LocalStorage.
- Advanced Feature: Players can also draw paths by holding down the mouse button and moving across the grid.

The goal of the game is to enhance logical thinking and strategic planning in an interactive and engaging way.
